# Week-9-Test

**Name at least two things to check for debugging for when your code isn’t working (bonus points for more then two)**


**Why won’t this work? In your HTML: `<input class=”.some-element” type=“text” />` In your Javascript: `$(“.another-element”).val();`**


**What’s the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery?**


**What does `var name = $(‘.name-field’).val();` do?**


**How do we make sure an element is hidden when the page is first loaded? Hint: you don’t need any javascript! How do we then unhide that element using javascript?**


**What’s the difference between `$(‘#myElement’)` and `$(‘.myElement’)`?**
