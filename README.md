# Week-9-Test

**Name at least two things to check for debugging for when your code isn’t working (bonus points for more than two).**

-That you’re using the right thing for your javascript the # or .
-The inspect element on your web page
-check that your tags are in the right place




**Why won’t this work? In your HTML: `<input class=”.some-element” type=“text” />` In your Javascript: `$(“.another-element”).val();`**

There is no such thing as an input class. It needs to be input type and the javascript is fine



**What’s the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery?**

Javascript and jquery both have $ calling tags 


**What does `var name = $(‘.name-field’).val();` do?**

Lets the person put in their name and submits it onto the page



**How do we make sure an element is hidden when the page is first loaded? Hint: you don’t need any javascript! How do we then unhide that element using javascript?**

Css rule display:none javascript $(“.some-element”).show();


**What’s the difference between `$(‘#myElement’)` and `$(‘.myElement’)`?**

One is an ID and the other is a class
